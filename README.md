Procedural code project for F.G.C.U. COP 2001 Programming Methodology

#### Contained within is the source code

# Overview of the project
This project is for my COP-2001 Programming Methodology at Florida Gulf Coast University (F.G.C.U.) the aim of this project is to create a intentory system for a fictitious company called OraclProduction Ltd. The program is to be a console driven program using only procedural programming with no use of classes in C++.
Users should be able to create employee profiles in the system, increase product counts, add new products, display currect counts on each item and information on the item, new products can be added at any point, and production statistics can be veiwed. 

### Product Backlog(PBL)
   * The program will be a menu driven console program.  
   * The program must use procedural programming only, no classes. 
   * Employee accounts can be made.
   * Products that can be made: Music Player, Movie Player
   * Allow a user to Add a new product and to specify how many items of that product should be created. The program will then create these items and store them in a collection.
   * The collection can be displayed at any time.
   * New Products can be added at any time.
   * Production statistics can be displayed â€“ Total items produced, number of each item, the number of unique products created etc.
